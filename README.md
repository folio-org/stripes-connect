## Introduction

Stripes Connect provides essentially one service: the ability to
upgrade a regular React component into a Connected Component. This is
done by importing the `connect()` method from `stripes-connect`,
defining a data manifest, and exporting not the React component itself
but the result of wrapping it in a call to `connect()`:

```
import { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'stripes-connect';
class MyStripesComponent extends Component {
  static manifest = { 'resourceName': { params: values } };
  // ...
}
export default connect(MyStripesComponent, 'moduleName');
```

## Documentation

* The API and data manifest are explained in detail in
[The Stripes Connect API](doc/api.md).
* A complete worked example of a connected component for editing patrons
is explained in
[A component example: the **PatronEdit** component](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/component-example.md).
* New features and migration paths for modules to opt-in to them are explained in [Migration Paths](MIGRATIONPATHS.md)
