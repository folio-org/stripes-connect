## [2.7.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v2.7.0) (2017-09-01)

* Support `dataKey` to have different instances of a component maintain their own data. This is a "major" change in that affects a lot of the internals and provides significant new functionality; but since it is backwards-compatible -- components without a `dataKey` behave the same as before -- it can be released as a non-breaking minor release. Fixes STRPCONN-1.

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v2.3.0) (2017-06-29)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1)

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v2.2.0) (2017-06-08)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0)

* Fix implementation of `!{prop.subprop}` in manifest-path substitution.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0)

* Remove 'clear' manifest option and ability to merge resources.
* Manifest functions are permitted to return more than just strings.
* Pass through 'okapi' property from the store as a prop, eventually we will make this a general facility.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v1.0.0) (2017-05-09)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v0.3.0...v1.0.0)

* Initial support for paging. Documented in the API guide, particularly the `requiredRecords` manifest entry.
* Query parameters now broken out into a `params` property in the manifest.
* Remove the old _Thinking in Stripes_ document, which is now a section in the _Stripes Module Developer's Guide_ in stripes-core.
* Bump to major version 1, so that semantic versioning will start working correctly, allowing NPM dependencies to identify forwards-compatible newer minor versions.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v0.3.0) (2017-04-06)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

* Add support for new `!{prop.subprop}` syntax in path strings,
  substituting in the value of a property from the component. Document
  this in the API guide. Fixes STRIPES-299.
* Remove the obsolete stub `api.md` file from the root directory. The
  API guide has been in the `doc` directory for a long tine now.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v0.2.0) (2017-03-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

* Switch to using the new release of [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). This significantly changes the API for URL-derived props and for changing the URL. In addition to their detailed documentation you may also find [this commit](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-items/commit/adf24349efef3bf2dc5928c8a76a5991369577b9) illustrative.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v0.1.0) (2017-03-12)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/compare/v0.0.9..v0.1.0)

* `connect()` now accepts and uses an optional third argument, `logger` -- a logger fulfilling the API exemplified by [stripes-logger](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-logger). If no argument is passed, a very basic logger is used that simply falls back to console.log
* The logger object is now used for some (not yet all) internal logging, and is also passed to path functions.
* `connectFor()` now curries a second argument: a logger as well as a module.

## [0.0.9](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/tree/v0.0.9) (2017-03-01)

* Add optional "status" element to the object passed to error-handlers. See https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-connect/blob/master/doc/api.md#error-handling for details. Fixes STRIPES-224.

## 0.0.8 (2017-02-24)

* First version to have a documented change-log. Each subsequent version will describe its differences from the previous one.
